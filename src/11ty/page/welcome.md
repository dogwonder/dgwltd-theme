===========================================================================

Shape up, man. You’re a slacker. You wanna be a slacker for the rest of your life?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### No, fine, no , good, fine, good.

#### Um, well it’s a delorean, right?

##### Well, safe and sound, now, n good old 1955.

###### Oh hey, Biff, hey, guys, how are you doing?

Whoa, whoa, Biff, what’s that? You can’t, uh, that is, uh, nobody’s home. You know, Doc, you left your equipment on all week. Nothing’s coming to my mind. Nah, I just don’t think I’m cut out for music.

Marty, such a nice name. Yeah. **George**. What’s with the life preserver? Alright, okay listen, keep your pants on, she’s over in the cafe. God, how do you do this? *What made you change your mind, George*?

Okay Doc, this is it. Yeah man, that was good. Let’s do another one. You do? So tell me, future boy, who’s president of the United States in 1985? Flux capacitor.

- Marty, will we ever see you again? 
  - Wait a minute, what are you doing, Doc?
  - Good. Have a good trip Einstein, watch your head.
  - I think I know exactly what you mean.
- Listen, Doc, you know there’s something I haven’t told you about the night we made that tape.
- You know Marty, you look so familiar, do I know your mother?

1. Let him go, Biff, you’re drunk.
2. Save the clock tower.
3. Tab? I can’t give you a tab unless you order something.
