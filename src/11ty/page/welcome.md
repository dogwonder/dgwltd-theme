<span class="background">Ola</span> <span class="foreground">DGW.ltd</span>
===========================================================================

An open-source hybrid theme for WordPress. This leans heavily on block based theming, although is not a Full Site Editing (FSE) theme, rather a combination of custom blocks, [theme.json](https://github.com/dogwonder/dgwltd-theme/blob/main/theme.json) and PHP templating, [read more](https://github.com/dogwonder/dgwltd-theme).

This site uses [DeLorean ipsum](https://satoristudio.net/delorean-ipsum/) for placeholder text, and some Back to the Future based fun.

There is also a [custom plugin](https://github.com/dogwonder/dgwltd-plugin) for this site that allows for a bunch of custom blocks. The [blocks page](http://dev.wp.dgw.ltd/blocks/) uses many of these.
