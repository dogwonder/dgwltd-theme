# About

This is an attempt at turning my WordPress blog @ [dogwonder.co.uk](http://dogwonder.co.uk) into a WP GraphQL / [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev) powered site. I took a lot of inspiration from these various excellent approaches:

[How to use 11ty with Headless WordPress and deploy to Netlify](https://davedavies.dev/post/how-to-use-11ty-with-headless-wordpress/)

[WordPress &amp; Eleventy part one: WordPress](https://danabyerly.com/articles/wordpress-and-eleventy-part-one-wordpress/)

[11ty-wordpress-graphql](https://github.com/most-useful/11ty-wordpress-graphql) (Github repo)
