# Guide page &#8211; 2

George: you ever think of running for class president? Marty, I always wear a suit to the office. You alright? I’m, I’m sorry, Mr. McFly, I mean, I was just starting on the second coat. Science Fiction Theater. Hey kid, what you do, jump ship?

Oh, you make it sound so easy. I just, I wish I wasn’t so scared. Yes, definitely, god-dammit George, swear. Okay, so now, you come up, you punch me in the stomach, I’m out for the count, right? And you and Lorraine live happily ever after.
