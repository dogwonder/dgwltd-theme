<p>George: you ever think of running for class president? Marty, I always wear a suit to the office. You alright? I’m, I’m sorry, Mr. McFly, I mean, I was just starting on the second coat. Science Fiction Theater. Hey kid, what you do, jump ship?</p>



<p>You’ll find out. Calm down, Marty, I didn’t disintegrate anything. The molecular structure of Einstein and the car are completely intact. Yeah well, you shouldn’t drink. Oh, you make it sound so easy. I just, I wish I wasn’t so scared. Yes, definitely, god-dammit George, swear. Okay, so now, you come up, you punch me in the stomach, I’m out for the count, right? And you and Lorraine live happily ever after.</p>



<p>He’s an absolute dream. You don’t understand. What’s with the life preserver? Who the hell is John F. Kennedy? Oh, I’ve been so worried about you ever since you ran off the other night. Are you okay? I’m sorry I have to go. Isn’t he a dream boat?</p>
