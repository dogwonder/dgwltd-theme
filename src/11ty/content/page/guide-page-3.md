# Guide page &#8211; 3

Well uh, good, fine. Well, Marty, I’m almost eighteen-years-old, it’s not like I’ve never parked before. Yeah, I think it’s a major embarrassment having an uncle in prison. Wrecked? When did this happen and- Mother, with Marty’s parents out of town, don’t you think he oughta spend the night, after all, Dad almost killed him with the car.

No no no this sucker’s electrical, but I need a nuclear reaction to generate the one point twenty-one gigawatts of electricity- Where were we. That’s a great idea. I’d love to park. Look me up when you get there, guess I’ll be about 47. Whoa, whoa, Biff, what’s that?

Marty. Marty. Marty. You too. Of course, from a group of Libyan Nationalists. They wanted me to build them a bomb, so I took their plutonium and in turn gave them a shiny bomb case full of used pinball machine parts. I know what you’re gonna say, son, and you’re right, you’re right, But Biff just happens to be my supervisor, and I’m afraid I’m not very good at confrontations. Thank you, don’t forget to take a flyer.
