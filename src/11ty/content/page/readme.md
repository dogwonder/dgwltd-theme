# Readme

An open-source hybrid theme for WordPress. This leans heavily on block based theming, although is not a Full Site Editing (FSE) theme, rather a combination of custom blocks (mostly via [ACF PRO](https://www.advancedcustomfields.com)), [theme.json](https://github.com/dogwonder/dgwltd-theme/blob/main/theme.json), [GOV.UK front end](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend) (a subset of) and PHP templating, [full Readme here](https://github.com/dogwonder/dgwltd-theme#readme).

This site uses [DeLorean ipsum](https://satoristudio.net/delorean-ipsum/) for placeholder text, and some Back to the Future based fun.

There is also a [custom plugin](https://github.com/dogwonder/dgwltd-plugin) for this site that allows for a bunch of custom blocks:

- DGW.ltd Accordion – based on GOV.UK’s [accordion pattern](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/accordion/)
- DGW.ltd Banner – text and background image similar to hero but less showy
- DGW.ltd Breadcrumbs – based on GOV.UK’s [breadcrumbs pattern](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/breadcrumbs/)
- DGW.ltd Cards – grid of cards linking to other pages, title, excerpt and featured image
- DGW.ltd Embed – lite embed custom element for [Youtube](https://github.com/paulirish/lite-youtube-embed) and [Vimeo](https://github.com/slightlyoff/lite-vimeo)
- DGW.ltd Promo card – offset image and content block
- DGW.ltd Hero Section – hero with big image / video as background
